📊 Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Business Insights
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, starting from raw data ingestion to actionable business insights.
It covers data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, SQL-based analysis, interactive dashboard creation, and final reporting.

The goal of this project is to showcase practical data analytics skills using Python, SQL, and Power BI in a real-world scenario.

📁 Dataset

Source: Public / Sample business dataset

Format: CSV

Description:

Customer demographics

Purchase behavior
